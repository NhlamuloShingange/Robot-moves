How to Count Unique squares a robot visits in java console

You work for a company that sells robots that move around a factory floor in a grid like pattern. Your
boss has asked you to write a program that will test how many unique squares a robot visits given a
set of instructions.
For example the input N4,E2,S2,W4 (described below) should result in a value of 11.
From the starting position the robot heads north for four blocks, east for two blocks, south for two and
west for four. During those steps it visits blocks 1-12 once except for block 2 which it visits twice. Block
2 should only be counted once. The size of the grid is unknown and not given in the input.
